    FileUltimate does not depend on any Web.config settings to work (it's config-free for easy deployment).
    However if you want to support the lowest level upload method Html4 which is the only possible method 
    for old browsers without Html5 or Flash or Silverlight support, then you will need to increase the 
    request limits so that you can upload files larger than 4MB and 28.6 MB on these browsers.  
    Html4 upload method requires the limits to be set to the maximum possible value as it sends the whole
    file in a single request (multipart/form-data). Other upload methods use chunking so there is no upper limit 
    for them and they do not require these settings.
    For more information see, https://docs.gleamtech.com/fileultimate/html/optional-upload-configuration.htm
